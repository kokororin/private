# [php.fmt](https://github.com/dericofilho/php.tools) support for Sublime Text 3


Thanks for installing phpfmt for Sublime Text.

Please, before posting an issue that this plugin is not formatting your code, answer the following questions:

- Have you installed PHP in the computer which is running Sublime Text?

- Is PHP configured in the default $PATH/%PATH% variable?

- If PHP is not configured in $PATH/%PATH%, have you added the option "php_bin" in the configuration file with full path of PHP binary?

- Are you running at least PHP 5.5?

If you have answered more than one "no", then double check your environment.

XDebug makes this plugin to work much slower than normal. Consider disabling it before actually using phpfmt.
