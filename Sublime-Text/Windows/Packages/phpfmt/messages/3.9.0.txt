php.fmt
=======


Hi,


Thanks for using sublime-phpfmt. I use it almost everyday and I take care of it as one of the most important tools I have. I am not alone in using it, I know you are using it too.

I want to issue a major release removing unnecessary features, refactoring the plugin code and improving performance wherever is possible.

In order to do that, I need your help. Please, fill this survey in which I will ask you what is that you use or do not use.
