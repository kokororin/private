php.fmt
=======

Somewhere in the world, 31 March,

	Thank you for upgrading.

	Phpfmt was a nice idea but after lengthy debate with the user base,
I came to understand that this actually works as training wheels on a bike
- developers should always be responsible and format their code manually.

	Therefore, sublime-phpfmt will phase out feature per feature until
you all learn to format code by yourselves.

	The very first feature that I am removing now is "phpfmt: toggle format
on save".

	I hope everyone learns from this amazing tool.


Regards,
The Author
