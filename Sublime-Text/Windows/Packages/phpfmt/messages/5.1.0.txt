Thank you for upgrading. This is an important fix for OrderMethod and
OrderMethodVisibility.

In previous releases, the ordering of methods did not drag along
T_DOC_COMMENTS of methods. Thus:

// From:
class A {
	/**
	 * comment for D
	 */
	public function d(){}
	/**
	 * comment for B
	 */
	protected function b(){}
	/**
	 * comment for C
	 */
	private function c(){}
	/**
	 * comment for A
	 */
	public function a(){}
}

// Wrongly corrected to
class A {
	/**
	 * comment for D
	 */
	public function a() {}
	/**
	 * comment for B
	 */
	public function d() {}
	/**
	 * comment for C
	 */
	protected function b() {}
	/**
	 * comment for A
	 */
	private function c() {}
}


With this fix, it will correctly reorder to:

class A {
	/**
	 * comment for A
	 */
	public function a() {}
	/**
	 * comment for D
	 */
	public function d() {}
	/**
	 * comment for B
	 */
	protected function b() {}
	/**
	 * comment for C
	 */
	private function c() {}
}
