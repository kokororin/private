php.fmt
=======

Call to arms:

(Un)fortunatelly, I have been coding less and less in PHP. I understand
there is a small community around both sublime-phpfmt and php.tools.

Thus, I am calling all people interested in these tools to help me to
keep them alive.

Right now, I do not have any documentation to help you to provide support
and to propose PRs. But as soon as I see people taking action, I shall
help them to write such documentation and implement improvements on these
tools.

Eventually, I plan to move both projects to an independent account and
to have it run by a maintenance team.

Please! Take action and support these projects.
