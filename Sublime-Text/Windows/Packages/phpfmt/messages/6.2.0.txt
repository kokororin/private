Thanks for upgrading this plugin.

As announced in v5.0.7, as of this release, I shall keep occasional updates both
for this plugin and its engine. Therefore, I call the community of their users to
support both with Pull Requests and answering at Issue Tracker.

I am ready to support anyone willing to step up to become contributors of these
projects. Just ping @ccirello in Issue Tracker.
