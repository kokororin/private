php.fmt
=======

Thank you for upgrading.


php.fmt now is under the management of https://github.com/phpfmt/

This is the first step to handover this plugin to the community.

Eventually, I shall stop altogether providing updates and fixes. So, if
you use and care about this plugin, please get involved in the
development of https://github.com/phpfmt/php.tools and
https://github.com/phpfmt/sublime-phpfmt.
